    <ol>
      	<li>As a user I would like the website to be hosted online so that I can visit it.</li>
      	<p>For our first sprint, we mainly focused on hosting our website online and connecting it to a PostgreSQL database. Jim encountered some troubles hosting the website on flyio and Austin assisted him by hosting it using GCP instead. We also used this spring cycle to write out all of the stories that we need to finish for this assignment. That way we can better plan ahead in terms of how many points we should do for future sprints.</p>

    <h3><u>Product Backlog</u></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>As a user I want to be able to create a new event so that I can share it with other users.</li>
      <li>As a user I want to see a footer on all pages of the website so that I can navigate the website easily.</li>
      <li>As a developer I want to have a database for RSVPs so that I can keep track of this data.</li>
      <li>As a developer I want to have a database for events so that I can keep track of this data.</li>
      <li>As a user I would like the website to have a cool theme so that it looks good enhancement</li>
    </ol>
    <p>While we are still working on finalizing the contents of our second spring, we would like to get more features shipped for this cycle since we are more experience with the scrum workflow and working together as a team. Together, these features would flesh out the databases that we need to store critical information. In addition, it would add the CSS and footer to the site to make it more visually appealing to the users. Looking further ahead, we can build on the databases we build in order to implement the RSVP and event functionality.</p>
